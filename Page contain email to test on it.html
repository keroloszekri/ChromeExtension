        Here’s the latest news on the outbreak.<h>kerolos.zekri@gmail.com</h>
        25 March 11:00 GMT — India starts 3-week lockdown
        ndia has commenced a 21-day lockdown, after prime minister Narendra Modi ordered 
        the country's 1.3 billion residents to remain in their homes from midnight 24 March.
        Many countries have introduced travel restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
        But with the world's second largest population, the scale of India's lockdown will dwarf
        other nations.Currently the country has roughly 500 reported cases, and 9 reported deaths,
        but researchers say infections are probably going undetected there given the size of its 
        population. The country has tested about 15,000 people for the coronavirus as of 20 March,
        according to Our World in Data.mysite@ourearth.com my.ownsite@ourearth.org mysite@you.me.net
        Under the new restrictions, planes and trains are suspended and roads restricted in every 
        state. Medical centres, petrol stations and grocery stores are exempt from the lockdown.
        “The nation will have to certainly pay an economic cost because of this lockdown. However,
        to save the life of 
        each and every Indian is our top most priority," said Modi during a televised address.
        25 March 01:00 GMT — The outbreak in Italy went undetected for weeks
        The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was in Northern Italy as early as 1 January.
        An epidemiological analysis of Lombardy, the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, 
        reveals that the first onset of symptoms in the country occurred weeks before the disease
        was reported there on 20 February. The study looks at nearly 6,000 laboratory-confirmed 
        cases to track how the outbreak unfolded in the region. It was posted to the arXiv preprint 
        server on 20 March.
        Covert coronavirus infections could be seeding new outbreaks
        The undetected spread in January is “very striking”, says Michele Tizzoni, 
        an infectious disease modeller at the ISI Foundation in Turin, Italy, who
        was not involved in the work. “At that time we were probably still talking about Wuhan.”
        Instead, by the time the first boules.samir@gmail.com case was detected in Italy, the virus had 
        already spread to most towns and cities in Southern Lombardy. Over the next several weeks,
        nearly half of the patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were hospitalised; about
        one-fifth of those required intensive care.
        The new picture of the outbreak in Lombardy makes it clear that “aggressive containment 
        strategies are required” to stop the spread of the virus, the authors write. Although
        public activities and gatherings in the region were banned just 3 days after the first 
        positive test, the undetected spread in the weeks 
        prior meant that the virus had already taken hold, with cases doubling roughly every 3 days.
        These data will be vital to other countries and public health organisations getting ready 
        to face their own outbreaks of the pandemic, Tizzoni says. His advice to them? “Be prepared.
        Even if you don’t see much.”
        24 March 11:00 GMT — Lockdowns eased in Hubei province

        Chinese authorities are reopening travel to and from Hubei province, the epicentre
        of the COVID-19 outbreak, ending two months of lockdowns that were introduced to help slow 
        the disease’s spread. Only one new infection has been reported in Hubei since 18 March.
        How blood from coronavirus survivors might keep hospitals afloat
        From 25 March, flights and trains in 01208250319 and out of all cities in Hubei province —
        except for the capital, Wuhan — will resume, and roads will reopen, according 
        to an announcement posted on Hubei province’s website. Access to Wuhan, where
        the first cases were reported 0110825031 and spread, will remain restricted until 8 April.
        Until then, all those entering or leaving the city will have to take a test to
        prove that they are not infected with SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
        The Hubei announcement says 01108250319 that factories and businesses can gradually reopen, 
        as long as they follow transmission prevention measures. Universities, schools 
        and child-care centres will remain closed pending “a scientific assessment of 
        the epidemic control situation”. (Schools in most other regions of China also
        remain closed.)
        Other cities in China are slowly returning to some sense of normality. 
        But scientists are warning that there is a risk of renewed COVID-19 
        transmission once people start mixing again.

        23 March 21:15 GMT — United Kingdom implements stringent lockdown

        The United Kingdom is implementing drastic measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus,
        joining other nations that have put in place unprecedented rules to fight the pandemic.

        Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in a televised broadcast on 23 March that people living 
        in the United Kingdom must stay at home and travel outside only for essential purposes. The police 
        will have powers to enforce the rules and fine people who stray from them.

        People will be allowed to leave their houses only to shop for food and medical supplies, exercise once a 
        day, and travel to work if strictly necessary. Shops that sell non-essential items will close and gatherings
        of more than two people in public will be banned.

        The United Kingdom had already issued guidelines for social distancing, but Johnson said that although huge 
        numbers are complying, “the time has now come for us all to do more”. The government had also been broadly 
        criticized for not putting in place stricter measures to curb the spread of the virus sooner. The latest 
        rules will be kept under review but will last for at least three weeks.

        The United Kingdom has recorded 6,650 confirmed cases of the virus, with 335 deaths, but the true figures
        are feared to be much higher.

        The country joins other European nations that are already on lockdown; in some of these, measures are 
        stricter and people cannot leave their houses without a permit. Lockdowns are in effect in Spain and
        Italy — which is experiencing the world’s worst outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the 
        coronavirus. Germany has also banned public gatherings of more than two people.

        More than a dozen US states are implementing stay-at-home orders, affecting more one-third of the US 
        population. Details of these orders, and the lengths of time for which they will apply, vary from state 
        to state, but they generally include the closures of all non-essential businesses, and continued or more 
        stringent bans on public gatherings. On 19 March, California, the nation’s most populous state, was the
        first state to order a lockdown, following the lead of San Francisco three days earlier.

        In New York state, home to about 5% of worldwide COVID-19 cases, authorities can fine businesses that
        do not comply with orders, but people will not face penalties. In Oregon, however, people who violate
          the governor’s order can be tried for a misdemeanour offence.


        President Donald Trump has also approved the mobilization of US National Guard troops in New York,
        California and Washington to set up medical stations and deliver aid to residents.

        23 March 17:35 GMT — Global infections pass 300,000

        The number of COVID-19 coronavirus infections worldwide passed 300,000 over the weekend. The World Health 
        Organization (WHO) reported 332,935 cases — across nearly every country — as of 23 March, with 14,510 deaths.

        WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press briefing that it took 67 days from the first 
        reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days after that to reach 200,000 and just another 
        4 days to top 300,000 infections.

        20 March 12:15 GMT — Most COVID-19 deaths now in Italy

        Deaths from COVID-19 in Italy have exceeded those reported in China, after 473 people died in Italy 
        in 24 hours. The coronavirus has so far killed 3,405 people there, according to official statistics
        from 19 March. In China, 3,242 people have died of the disease since the outbreak began in December, 
        according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

        Globally, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases has doubled in less than two weeks, to more than 
        200,000.

        On 19 March, seven countries confirmed their first coronavirus cases, including Zambia, Gambia,
        Mauritius and Kyrgyzstan, according to the WHO.

        19 March 20:00 GMT — Coronavirus hospitalizations occur at any age, says US CDC

        COVID-19 can be severe enough to require hospitalization in adults of any age, according to a report from
        the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).


        Covert coronavirus infections could be seeding new outbreaks
        The report, released on 18 March, analyses the severity of COVID-19 cases in the United States from 12
        February to 16 March by age group. Although mortality is highest in adults over 65 — consistent with
          data reported from China, Italy and elsewhere — 20% of US hospitalizations occurred in people aged 20–44 years.

        The CDC’s report excludes cases imported from Wuhan, China, or from Japan, so it did not count people 
        who were infected on cruise ships in those areas. In total, age data were collected for 2,449 infected 
        people. Of them, 29% were between 20 and 45 years old.

        That statistic is roughly consistent with numbers released by the Italian Higher Institute of Health, 
        which reported on 15 March that 24% of cases in the country occurred in adults aged 19–50. These data 
        do not include age-group breakdowns for severe cases, only fatalities. Deaths from COVID-19 in Italy 
        surpassed those in China on 19 March.


        The coronavirus pandemic in five powerful charts
        Among people with COVID-19 aged 20–44 in the United States, the CDC’s report estimates that up to
        21% required hospitalization. But only 2–4% of infected people in that age bracket required intensive 
        care, significantly fewer than in any other adult age group. And fatalities remain low among young 
        adults, the report shows.

        No data were collected regarding underlying conditions that have been shown to make people more 
        susceptible to the disease, so it is unclear whether the young adults being hospitalized are those 
        who are most vulnerable. Still, the report stresses, severe illness “can occur in adults of any age”.


        19 March 11:00 GMT — No new confirmed cases in Hubei province

        On 18 March, Hubei, the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, recorded no
        new cases of COVID-19 for the first time since the beginning of the epidemic, according to the
          country’s National Health Commission. Eight deaths were reported in the province that day.

        A month ago, Hubei was confronting several thousand new confirmed cases each day. Since December,
        it has recorded more than 67,000 people with COVID-19, and more than 3,000 deaths.

        Across China, there were 39 new cases recorded on 18 March, and 13 deaths.

        Italy now faces the largest number of new cases per day, with 3,526 confirmed yesterday. 
        New cases have also surged in the United States, Iran, Spain, France and Germany.

        18 March 10:00 GMT — Deaths outside China surpass those inside the country
        The total number of people who have died from COVID-19 outside China has overtaken deaths 
        inside the country for the first time since the disease emerged, according to reports by the
        World Health Organization (WHO) on 16 March. The number of confirmed infections outside China 
        surpassed those inside the country on the same day.
        As of 17 March, there were 179,112 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, including 81,116 
        in China. Of the 7,426 deaths from the disease, 3,231 have been in China.

        Europe had the largest 24-hour spike in new infections, with 8,507 reported since 16 March,
        and 428 deaths. Several regions recorded their first cases, including Somalia, Benin, Liberia and the Bahamas.

        17 March 00:30 GMT — First vaccine clinical trials begin in the United States

        coronavirus vaccine on 16 March.Credit: Ted S Warren/AP/Shutterstock

        The first phase I clinical trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine has begun in Seattle, Washington.

        Four adults, the first of 45 eventual participants, received their first doses of an
        experimental vaccine developed through a partnership between the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Moderna, a biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But although it is an important milestone, the phase I trial is just the beginning of a long process to test the drug’s safety and efficacy.

        The trial is being conducted at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, 
        and will test a range of doses of the vaccine. Over the next 6 weeks, participants will receive their first doses, followed by a second 28 days later. Follow-up visits both in person and over the phone will assess participants’ health over a 14-month period, and blood samples will help researchers evaluate the body’s immune response to the experimental vaccine.

        The potential vaccine is based on messenger RNA, which directs the body to make a
        protein found on the coronavirus’s outer shell
        The hope is that this will elicit an immune response that protects against infection.

        What China’s coronavirus response can teach the rest of the world
        The team at Moderna had already been working on a vaccine for Middle East
        respiratory syndrome, which is caused by another coronavirus. 
        The viruses’ similarities helped the researchers pivot to the search for a COVID-19 vaccine.
        As a result, the phase I trial was “launched in record speed”, according to a
        statement from NIAID Director Anthony Fauci on 16 March. It took just 66 days 
        from genetic sequencing of the virus to the first human injection of the vaccine candidate
